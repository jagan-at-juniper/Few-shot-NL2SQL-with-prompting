heatmap of floor,,,,,This is a Page Redirection Intent.  ,,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/good-location-setup/,1.4265317,To scale the floor plan Select Live View from the Location side navigation menu. 2. Select the site and floor plan you want to scale 3. Click on Setup floor plan. 4. Confirm by clicking OK. 5. Select the Set Scale option. 6. Scale the floor plan and save. Scale can be thought of as the foundation for your location accuracy. If for example a room is 10 meters long but you scale the room to be 1000 meters long in the system then when you physically walk 5 meters the system UI would only reflect you as moving one inch. This gives the false impression that the location is broken; however the location has actually placed you correctly based on the provided scale. Thus it is crucial that your floor plan is scaled properly. One trick if you dont know the scale of a floor plan is to look for a standard door and scale that door to be 0.91 meters (3 feet). This should scale the floor plan appropriately. Next set AP placement. Note: Set Origin can be used to modify the 00 coordinates of the floor plan. This is typically not necessary and is most commonly used in conjunction with third party systems.,snippet,,1,0

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/wired-service-level-expectations-sle/,1.3893678,The details for interface anomalies are all obtained from the switch. The data is then correlated into a format that is easier to consume for users. The Interface Anomalies Classifier is split up into 3 Sub-Classifiers: MTU Mismatch Cable Issues and Negotiation Failed. Admins have the ability to set the Max Transmission Unit (MTU) on each interface (The default is 1514 for gigabit interfaces). If the interface needs the ability to send Jumbo Frames the MTU is set to a higher 9216. MTU needs to be the same value along the path of the packet and if there are any MTU Mismatches the packets will be discarded. In Juniper switches MTU mismatches can be identified under MTU Errors and Input Errors. Every time an Input Error or MTU Error is observed on an interface we calculate a bad user minute for that user. If a physical cable on your network setup is faulty we will detect this and the Cable Issues Sub-classifier will indicate failure. Latency can be observed on ports when Local or remote device settings are misconfigured Auto-negotiation fails or when there is a possible duplex conflict. Older devices may not be able to negotiate at full speed and will fall back to a slower link speed of 100 Mbps. These scenarios can cause latency issues for clients connected.,snippet,,3,2

WxLAN/Policies define a list of rules restrictions and other settings that can be applied to devices in order to change how they are treated by the network. Add labels and policies at the organization level to be applied to multiple sites at once. Setup Org level policies using the same method as site level policies. First create and define your Org level labels accessible through Organization -> Labels. Using these Org labels create Org Policies in the template view (Organization -> Config Templates). Organization level policies take precedence over Site level policies so your Site level policies will only take effect only if none of the Org level policy conditions match the client behavior.

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/wxlan-policy/,1.3096296,1. The first step is to create labels. Creating labels can be done for both Users and Resources for which you want to add policy for. This can be done by clicking on Network on the left-hand navigation bar then select Labels. 2.Here you have the option to either select an existing label or add a new label by clicking on the Add Label button on the far top right of the page. 3.Once you have selected an existing label or clicked on the Add Label button it takes you to the Labels page. Where you can name the label choose a label type and set label values. As said earlier labels can be set for Users and Resources as well. User labels typically select the following Label Types  AAA attribute WiFi Client WLAN and Access Point. While Resources labels typically select the following label types  IP Address Hostname or application. 4.Once you selected your criteria for the labels click on Create to create the label. You can also define a label for IP/Protocol/Port. In this label entry you can enter the specific IP addresses of your client the Protocol (ICMP TCP UDP Other) and the port or range of ports being used. This can be used by WxLAN to filter out clients matching the combination of IP/Protocol/Port as defined by your label. 5.Labels can also be tagged to clients. This can be done by clicking Clients in the left-hand navigation then WiFi Clients and clicking on the client. Then click on + under Labels to add labels to specific clients. Click on save to save the setting. 6.To create a Network policy navigate to Network in the left-hand navigation then Policy to open the WxLAN page. 7.Here you can add rules or policy by clicking on the Add Rule tab. 8.You can add the labels you have created earlier under the Users and Resources sections by clicking on + under each of the sections. 9.The Resource labels can be set to either allowed or denied by clicking on the appropriate label. 10.Click on Save to save the setting. Note: The policy engine goes through the policies in sequence and applies the policy that exactly matches the client.,snippet,,4,1

Wikipedia ARP Filter: When ARP filter is enabled we block all ARP broadcast requests from going to the specified wireless Interface. When ARP filter Is disabled Proxy ARP will try to resolve the Ethernet address of requests and if not known will flood the original request to any Interface not being ARP filtered.Broadcast / Multicast Filter: When Enabled this filter will BLOCK ALL broadcasts and Multicast packets on a specified Interface except: a) ARPs (thats handled above) b) DHCP broadcast transactions. c) IPv6 Neighbor discovery frames.

When the SSID is created the AP will do a DHCP DORA for the Guest VLAN The AP requests the IP in order to create an SVI (Switch Virtual Interfaces) for the Guest VLAN on its eth0 interface which is used for the redirection of the client to the Guest portal page. Local Status Page As documented in AP Settings If the Local Status Page is configured for the Site  all the site APs will pull their own IP address from the Management VLAN but also addresses for each of the VLANs configured on the AP.

Enabling these may cause an increased amount of broadcasts. A simpler solution to access Apple TV across different subnets is to use bluetooth. AppleTV has a built in Bluetooth notification mechanism of its IP address so to access an AppleTV on a different SSID and VLAN simply enable bluetooth on your device and click on Airplay discovery. You will be able to see all AppleTVs both on your local subnet and those in range of the bluetooth on your device (few thousand square feet). Your client can then get the IP addresses via bluetooth and can connect freely once it knows the address.,snippet,,5,1

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/wifi-doesnt-work-certain-times-day/,1.3988178,Interference (especially Radar) may disrupt Wi-Fi services at a particular time of the day. Certain Wi-Fi dependent devices such as IoT devices Wi-Fi LED lights etc can also add to the channel utilization. This may lead to slowness or inability to pass traffic for the clients. You can review the Channel Occupancy of all the channels under NetworkRadio Management as well as the Channel Utilization for the AP under AP insights. To mitigate this you can use the Optimize Now button which will force the AP to change to the best available channel based on our scan radio calculations.,snippet,,4,0
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/wifi-doesnt-work-certain-times-day/,1.3678373,Our backend RRM algorithm upon detecting interference or radar may choose to change the channel on the AP. However the decision to change the channel on the AP is based on a baseline value it may take up to a few moments until the algorithm decides to change the channel. Additionally once the AP changes the channel it will momentarily drop all the clients associated to it by sending a Deauthentication and may cause a disruption in the Wi-Fi service for the AP momentarily. More information can be found on this under Channel utilization of the AP and the channel occupancy (Go to NetworkRadio Management) . Radio events give information on whether or not the AP actually changed channel/power or made any radio related changes.,snippet,,5,2

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/radio-management-event-types/,1.2349136,In Radio Management there are several event types in theRadio Events section of the page: The AP shouldnt automatically re-optimize unless necessary (ie: interference). So either you have to click Optimize Now to apply it immediately or you can wait until ~2:00AM local time for our backend to optimize for you Scheduled site RRM event occurs every day at around 3am.Here RRM automatically checks how the interference is between radios (and other noise sources) at a site and adjusts the channels to prevent such interferences for the following day. Triggered site RRM event will occur when you hit Optimize Now or make changes in the radio characteristics of an AP and save them. Auto channel selection event will occur when an AP reboots or when you add a new AP on your site  the new AP is getting the radio parameters automatically from the site. Auto Triggered ACS mainly happens 1 hour after auto channel selection. In Auto Triggered ACS RRM checks the AP channel and scan data to decide whether a better channel is available. Interference AP co-channelCo-channel interference occurs when 2 or more APs are using the same channel. It causes unnecessary contention as all APs and clients will be forced to defer transmissions until the medium is clear. So when AP detects this on Site AP changes the channel with a event of Interference AP co-channel Interference AP non wifiNon-wifi interference are non 802.11 devices. These devices include microwave ovens cordless phones Bluetooth devices wireless video cameras outdoor microwave links wireless game controllers Zigbee devices fluorescent lights WiMAX wireless bulbs and so on. Even bad electrical connections can cause broad RF spectrum emissions create interference. So when AP detects this on Site AP changes the channel with a event of Interference AP non wifi Radar detected : When APs use DFS channels they are required to backoff when radar is detected. Which shown as Radar detected event in UI.,snippet,,3,

In order for the effect to take place right away every RF change must be followed with an Optimize now for each of the bands (2.4GHz & 5GHz) where changes were made. Once the changes have been made the Radio Events table will reflect these RF changes as Triggered site RRM.,snippet,,4,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/why-do-clients-disconnect-when-you-add-a-new-wlan/,1.2254491,Making changes on the WLAN will cause the radio to reinitialize in order to obtain the new configuration. The radio reinitializes when adding a new WLAN or making any RF related changes to the WLAN. On the Client Events in the Insights page you will see an AP Deauthentication being sent to the clients when the changes are made. You can refer the audit log for the same. Because of this behavior we advise making WLAN changes on a site after business hours so that none of the services will get impacted.

Devices with different security options can connect to the same WLAN using their supported encryption method. With Multi-mode legacy devices and modern devices can connect to a single WLAN preventing the need of separate WLANs supporting different security options. Previously Multi-mode WLANs were limited to any combination of WPA WPA2 CCMP TKIP and WEP while using a PSK passphrase. This week we are extending the Multi-mode WLAN options by supporting EAP (802.1X) logins with WPA WPA2 CCMP and TKIP encryptions. To set up a Multi-mode WLAN create a new WLAN and expand the security options by clicking onMore Options. Here select Multi-mode/EAP(802.1X) and customize which encryption methods to configure your WLAN with. Be sure to add a RADIUS Authentication Server in order to finish setting up your WLAN. Note: Please contact Mist support to access this feature,snippet,,4,

Split tunneling ensures that only specific matching destinations are tunneled to Mist Edge while the rest of the remote users traffic egresses through home broadband. This will help conserve network bandwidth at DC or DMZ by not tunneling the entire remote users traffic. To configure a Split Tunnel for your Mist Edge navigate to Organization > Mist Tunnels and select enable under Split Tunnel. Here you need to specify your DNS server subnet and Tunnel Gateway.

The use of a proxy can provide extra security as well as a more controlled network environment. Now we allow integrating your proxy server with our Mist cloud in a seamless fashion. By providing your proxy server information inSite Settings our Mist APs will fetch this config and once placed in the correct environment connect directly to the proxy first before reaching out to the Mist Cloud. Heres how to set up your proxy configuration: Start with your Mist APs claimed to the site and connected to the cloud. It is necessary for them to fetch the proxy config from our cloud. Navigate toOrganization -> Site Settingsand find theSite Proxybox where you will need to provide your Proxy URL. Please enter in this format:http://user:password@proxy.internal:8080. Once the Site settings are saved you may disconnect your APs and migrate them to the proxy environment. The AP will have the proxy configurations stored from the config push from the previous step and will now work with your proxy server.,snippet,,5,

There are already a few existing ways to create a switch template and this week we are adding to that by allowing you to create templates directly from the Switch Details page. From the Utilities dropdown menu select Create Template. This will copy all of the existing switch configurations to a new template which may then be used to apply to other switches. To apply your Switch Configuration Template to a site go to your Switch Configuration page (Network > Switch Configuration) and select your desired site. Click into the site and at the top you may select a Configuration Template from the dropdown list. You may also select multiple sites from the list and apply a single template to them.,snippet,,2,

In the Mist Web GUI navigate to Organization > Settings. Under the Single Sign-on section create an Identity Provider by clicking Add IPD.Once you create an Identity the ACS URL and Single Logout URL will be created by default. 2. In Azure AD configure with the appropriate values: a. Identifier (Entity ID): Mist supports either a generic or an SSO-specific Entity ID. Generic: https://saml.mist.comSSO-specific: https://saml-<DOMAIN>.mist.comThis can be obtained from https://api.mist.com/api/v1/orgs/:org_id/ssos/:sso_id/metadata (replacing the :object_id with the appropriate IDs). b. Reply URL: Get the ACS URL directly from the UI.ie: https://api.mist.com/api/v1/saml/<DOMAIN>/login Both of these above values we need to set up under the Basic SAML Configuration. c. User identifier: user.mail d. SAML Token Attributes: Send the attributes with these names (case sensitive): FirstName LastName Name ID Role where Role is your custom LDAP rule to pass Mist the appropriate administrator role e. Mist requires the full Message to be signed: Under the Advanced Certificate Signing options select Sign SAML response and assertion. 3. In the Mist Web GUI finish configuring the SSO IdP: a. Issuer: Obtain from the AAD Federation Metadata. ie: https://sts.windows.net/01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef/ b. Certificate: Obtain from AAD. Note: Please make sure to include the cert headers/footers. c. SSO URL: Obtain from the AAD Federation Metadata. We can get the Login URL from the AD owner. 4. In the Mist Web GUI create the corresponding roles under the Single Sign-on section. The Role Name should match the Role being sent in the AAD SAML Assertion.,snippet,,2,

Now we have simplified the workflow by allowing you to apply your switch template from the same page where you created or imported your template. Please note that we did not remove the ability to assign sites in the Switch Configuration page  we simply added this ability onto the Switch Templates page. In the Switch Templates page (Organization > Switch Templates) you can now use the Assign to Sites function when viewing your templates. Use the pop up to easily assign your template to the intended sites.,snippet,,4,

This new Action will detect any coverage issues on your site and provide a floorplan visual of the APs on your map experiencing these issues. Use this visual to find the low coverage spaces identified on your site and make the necessary improvements. Make sure you have a Floorplan set up in Location Live View in order to take advantage of the Coverage hole visibility. Please keep in mind that this is still considered a Beta feature and there may be some bug fixes needed. We are working on ironing out any issues for a more complete release of this in the near future.,snippet,,2,

channel changes due to radar,,,,,,,

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/wifi-doesnt-work-certain-times-day/,1.4681855,Our backend RRM algorithm upon detecting interference or radar may choose to change the channel on the AP. However the decision to change the channel on the AP is based on a baseline value it may take up to a few moments until the algorithm decides to change the channel. Additionally once the AP changes the channel it will momentarily drop all the clients associated to it by sending a Deauthentication and may cause a disruption in the Wi-Fi service for the AP momentarily. More information can be found on this under Channel utilization of the AP and the channel occupancy (Go to NetworkRadio Management) . Radio events give information on whether or not the AP actually changed channel/power or made any radio related changes.,snippet,,2,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/channel-bonding-behavior-radar/,1.4459519,When the AP detects radar while using channel bonding all of the bonded channels will stop using the radar channels. The Access Point will switch to a different set of bonded channels which do not interfere with the detected radar.,snippet,,3,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/wifi-doesnt-work-certain-times-day/,1.4436762,Interference (especially Radar) may disrupt Wi-Fi services at a particular time of the day. Certain Wi-Fi dependent devices such as IoT devices Wi-Fi LED lights etc can also add to the channel utilization. This may lead to slowness or inability to pass traffic for the clients. You can review the Channel Occupancy of all the channels under NetworkRadio Management as well as the Channel Utilization for the AP under AP insights. To mitigate this you can use the Optimize Now button which will force the AP to change to the best available channel based on our scan radio calculations.,snippet,,4,

wayfinding paths,,,,,,,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/adding-wayfinding-paths/,1.7529002,Adding Wayfinding Paths,title,,1,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/adding-wayfinding-paths/,1.4455111,The wayfinding use case usually implies lots of hallways and intersections where people need help to find their destination. Wayfinding paths are the equivalent of Google Maps and Roads. They should be added by someone who has knowledge of the space and goal. A good example is a hospital where you would want paths in areas available to the public but not anywhere protected by a card reader. It is a good idea to create a paper map first to clarify any areas that are out of bounds. The blue dot (what people would see) will have a strong affinity to a path but if the location estimate gets 4 meters or so off the path it will detach and go into xy mode. In some use cases that is OK but keep this point in mind when you are designing for your use case. This is a quick video showing how you add way-finding paths. We strongly advise that you zoom the map and take a closer look at the lines. The lines might look like they connect when the map is scaled out but closer analysis might show that they actually do not connect. This will cause problems so please keep a lookout for this.,snippet,,2,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/mist-experience-mobile-app/,1.4412779,Way-finding is all about getting people to places. It refers to guiding people through a physical environment and enhancing their understanding and experience of the space. Indoor wayfinding is particularly important in complex built environments such as Educational Campus Healthcare Airports Museums Shopping malls and many more. To enable Wayfinding in Mist you need to enable it from the Mist Dashboard by adding wayfinding paths. Wayfinding paths are the equivalent of Google Maps and Roads. Mist has also partnered with map vendors such as Jibestream and Micello to enhance the wayfinding experience. To enable this feature you need to configure a third party map on the Mist Dashboard. Once Third-party maps (Micello or Jibestream) are imported and set up on the Mist Dashboard you can do wayfinding using this app.Wayfinding widget on the left side will help navigate to the desired destination.By clicking Navigate you can see a routing path to the destination and you can start walking on this path.Once you reach the location you can click on End Route and the path is removed from the map.

go to switch templates page,,,,,These are pure Page Redirection Intents.  No need to show documentation.,,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/may-20th-2021-updates/,1.5271811,To help improve the flow of configuring and applying Switch Templates we have added the ability to apply switch templates to sites directly from the Switch Templates page. Before we required you to first Create or Import a switch template and then navigate to the Network > Switch Configuration page to assign that template to a site. Now we have simplified the workflow by allowing you to apply your switch template from the same page where you created or imported your template. Please note that we did not remove the ability to assign sites in the Switch Configuration page  we simply added this ability onto the Switch Templates page. In the Switch Templates page (Organization > Switch Templates) you can now use the Assign to Sites function when viewing your templates. Use the pop up to easily assign your template to the intended sites.,snippet,,1,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/may-11th-2021-updates/,1.4807819,Use Switch Templates to help with configuring all of your switches in a manageable way especially if you have multiple sites with a large number of switches to look after. There are already a few existing ways to create a switch template and this week we are adding to that by allowing you to create templates directly from the Switch Details page. From the Utilities dropdown menu select Create Template. This will copy all of the existing switch configurations to a new template which may then be used to apply to other switches. To apply your Switch Configuration Template to a site go to your Switch Configuration page (Network > Switch Configuration) and select your desired site. Click into the site and at the top you may select a Configuration Template from the dropdown list. You may also select multiple sites from the list and apply a single template to them.,snippet,,2,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/september-17th-2020-updates/,1.4079767,This week we have made it easier for you to select switches to assign when configuring a switch template. Applying templates to switches are done by filtering switch roles switch models or the prefix of a switch name. We are improving the Apply by Switch name function by allowing you to specify an offset (in number characters) for where the name matching will start instead of just limiting you to prefix matching. This will be very useful for those sites with switch names with formats where the switch name does not come first e.g. Building #  Room #  Switch #. To apply a template to all switches with a certain name just enter your offset for which character to begin the name matching. Access your Switch Templates through Organization > Switch Templates.,snippet,,3,

Clients inactive for a defined amount of time will be deauthenticated from the network. Use this function in retail spaces where multiple clients connect to the WLAN but may stand idle after the user is done using the internet. This allows for active users to make use of the network and prevent the crowding of idle clients. Configure your inactivity timer in the range of 60  3600 seconds. By default the timer will be set for 1800 seconds. Navigate toNetwork->WLANsto find the Client inactivity section to modify the timer.,snippet,,2,

Use this to quickly get an overview on the client satisfaction across your network during any given time frame. You can even make this more specific asking Marvis to tell you unhappy users on a particular WLAN . By searching for unhappy users across a single WLAN on a site you have the ability to pinpoint specific areas where user satisfaction is not met. For example search for unhappy users on your guest WLAN to see if visitors are experiencing bad connectivity issues. Here is an example of the unhappy users query with the WLAN specified: Unhappy users at site Office and WLAN Rivendell,snippet,,3,

If you would like to use TKIP in your WLAN please contact us and we will enable this feature for you. WPA-2 with TKIP is enabled for compatibility with older clients that cannot be connected with the AES encryption protocol. If your device is compatible we recommend using WPA-2 with PSK (this uses AES) to configure your WLAN for maximum security. When setting up a new WLAN select the WPA-2 + TKIP option to configure your network using this protocol and encryption. Wikipedia,snippet,,4,

With Multi-mode legacy devices and modern devices can connect to a single WLAN preventing the need of separate WLANs supporting different security options. Previously Multi-mode WLANs were limited to any combination of WPA WPA2 CCMP TKIP and WEP while using a PSK passphrase. This week we are extending the Multi-mode WLAN options by supporting EAP (802.1X) logins with WPA WPA2 CCMP and TKIP encryptions. To set up a Multi-mode WLAN create a new WLAN and expand the security options by clicking onMore Options. Here select Multi-mode/EAP(802.1X) and customize which encryption methods to configure your WLAN with. Be sure to add a RADIUS Authentication Server in order to finish setting up your WLAN.

configuration applying to switches matching certain conditions dditional cli commands,,,,,,,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/june-25th-2020-updates/,1.3973252,We are very excited to announce that in addition to having a monitoring solution for switches on your site we are now rolling out the capability to make configuration changes to your switches directly from the Mist UI! Setting changes can be applied on a per-switch per-site and on a template basis. For supported switch models and firmware versions you may now make certain configuration changes on our dashboard GUI without the need for any CLI commands. Make configuration changes to areas including: Switch nameIP configuration (DHCP/Static)Port configurationRADIUSNTP We also include the option of entering CLI commands without the need to connect to the switch directly at all. Simply put in your command in the CLI configuration box and our cloud-ready switches will receive the changes. Please note that this feature is available by request only and compatible with these switch models and minimum firmwares: EX2300 EX3400: 18.2R3-S2 EX4300 EX4600 EX4650: 18.4R2-S2 Access the Switch Configuration page by navigating to Switches and selecting a Mist cloud-ready supported switch from your list.,snippet,,1,

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/deleting-commands-from-juniper-switches/,1.3559887,Once you have any of your Juniper EX switches managed by Mist cloud environment it is advised not to make any configuration changes from the switch CLI rather make use of Site/Template/Rule-based/Additional CLI Commands. Just selecting a few commands from any CLI box and hitting backspace/delete button will not have these commands deleted from the switch. By doing this you will only remove the commands from the below API which has current switch configuration that is present on Mist UI dashboard. You will see a Config Changed by User event generated under switch insights. And there will be no response to this event for config change as you have not pushed any config change to the switch. The changes were only made on UI and not on the switch. For example As seen from below screenshot we do not see a UI_COMMIT_COMPLETED for config changed by user at 02:14 PM when the CLI commands were removed from UI since no commands were sent to switch. To remove any config from the switch we need to append delete for any command that needs to be deleted. As seen from below screenshot we have set and delete commands. As we hit save these commands will be sent to switch and we will see a response event for config change performed by user as UI_COMMIT_COMPLETED. These changes are usually performed within a minute but the UI may take some time to reflect these changes. We will also see system commit on the switch for this timeframe. These delete commands will also be updated in the below API call. Once these changes are pushed to the switch these commands will be deleted from the switch. Later if required you can select and remove these commands from the CLI commands box and the same will be reflected under API.,snippet,,4,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/may-11th-2021-updates/,1.3557361,Use Switch Templates to help with configuring all of your switches in a manageable way especially if you have multiple sites with a large number of switches to look after. There are already a few existing ways to create a switch template and this week we are adding to that by allowing you to create templates directly from the Switch Details page. From the Utilities dropdown menu select Create Template. This will copy all of the existing switch configurations to a new template which may then be used to apply to other switches. To apply your Switch Configuration Template to a site go to your Switch Configuration page (Network > Switch Configuration) and select your desired site. Click into the site and at the top you may select a Configuration Template from the dropdown list. You may also select multiple sites from the list and apply a single template to them.,snippet,,5,

This feature is now out of Beta and available for everyone to use. With this setting enabled your guest users will still be able to pass traffic when the portal is down as a result of an AP losing cloud connectivity. Without this feature enabled your guest portal will not be fully operational in the event of your AP getting disconnected from the cloud. Use the fail-open feature to provide a seamless WiFi for your guests. To enable fail open for guest WLANs navigate to Network > WLANS and create a guest portal WLAN (internal and external portal options both work). In this box enable the Bypass guest/external portal in case of exception to turn on the fail open feature.,snippet,,5,

To configure by Subnet enter in your Destination IP address in the CIDR format as well as the Next Hop IP Address. To configure by Network select from the dropdown list. Make sure to create/add subnet for the VLAN ID network you intend to use for the static route. Also add a Next Hop IP Address. Other Areas where Static Routes can be configured: Site level  Navigate to Network > Switch Configuration to select the site where you wish to configure static routes. Org Template level  Navigate to Organization > Switch Template and select a template to configure your static routes.,snippet,,4,

Typical cancellation/conversion is 20-40% of APs in a site.A 2.4 radio will generally only be converted or canceled assuming there is adequate coverage from neighbor APs. The idea being when a 2.4 GHz is removed it should not cause the neighbor APs to increase their transmit power.When auto conversion or dual 5 GHz is used we recommend 20 MHz channels widths to maximize the number of 5 GHz radios while minimizing co-channel interference.Auto cancellation is supported on all Mist APs while Auto conversion is supported on the AP43 and AP63.,snippet,,3,

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/march-25th-2021-updates/,1.4728417,This week we are excited to announce Dual 5 GHz radios for supported AP models (AP43 AP63). This feature allows the 2.4 GHz radio on the AP to be converted to 5 GHz to provide additional coverage and additional capacity in the 5 GHz band. When APs are configured to operate in the 5 GHz dual band mode the dedicated 5 GHz radio will broadcast on the lower channels (below channel 100) while the dual band radio will broadcast on the upper channels (channel 100 and above) for RF separation. Dual 5 GHz can be configured on the AP details page RF templates and Device Profiles. On these pages you can find the Dual Band Radio Settings section. Here there are 3 options available: 2.4GHz 5GHz and Auto. 2.4 GHz: This is the default setting. Here the AP has one radio on 2.4 GHz and one on 5 GHz.5 GHz: Here the AP will use both radios to operate on the 5 GHz band.Auto: RRM determines if APs are placed close enough such that some APs can cumulatively provide enough coverage for the entire area in the 2.4GHz band. In these scenarios the 2.4GHz band is cancelled on the remaining APs and the dual band radio moves to operate on the 5GHz band. This function is called Auto Conversion. Auto Conversion and Cancellation APs without Dual band support can also be set to Auto but the 2.4 GHz radio cannot be converted  only cancelled when not needed. This is referred to as Auto Cancellation. When non Dual band APs are set to Auto RRM determines if APs are placed close enough such that some APs can cumulatively provide enough coverage for the entire area in the 2.4 GHz band. The remaining APs will then cancel their 2.4GHz band. In the RF Templates and Device Profiles pages enabling Auto in the Dual Band Radio Config box will enable Auto Conversion for the Dual Band AP models and Auto Cancellation for the rest of the APs. RF Template: Device Profile: From the AP Config page you may enable Auto Conversion for Dual Band APs in the Dual Band Radio Config section. For Non Dual Band APs you may enable Auto Cancellation in the 2.4 GHz Config section (In the dropdown menu you may select Auto). Dual Band AP: Non Dual Band AP:,snippet,,5,

This week we are expanding our wireless coverage support by enabling the option of UNII band Channel 144 to be turned on in the U.S. This option is available for 20MHz 40MHz and 80MHz but needs to be separately enabled underSite Configuration. To use this feature you must manually select this channel in yourAP Detailspage or in yourRadio Managementpage. The APs wont automatically use channel 144 if either page is set to Automatic for channel selection. Navigate toOrganization -> Site Configurationto enable the Channel 144 option. You can set this channel in theAccess Pointspage. In theNetwork -> Radio Managementspage you can manually select channel 144.,snippet,,1,

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/5ghz-channel-bonding-width-behavior/,1.1965077,Our Mist APs do not automatically adjust the 5GHz bonding width in accordance to interference on the network. The channel width is defined by the user (20MHz 40MHz(default) or 80MHz) and the AP will maintain this width unless the user changes the configuration. Most clients react badly when they see a BSSID with differing channel widths. It is not a recommended practice.,snippet,,3,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/channel-bonding-behavior-radar/,1.1916419,When the AP detects radar while using channel bonding all of the bonded channels will stop using the radar channels.

For example 40MHz signals cover 2 channels and 80MHz signals cover 4 channels. To show the exact channel range of your wide band signals we now list out all of the 20Mhz channels operating on the Access Point. Here AP 1 is configured for channel 36 with an 80MHz bandwidth. We show the exact range of this signal as the width of channels 36 40 44 and 48. AP 2 is configured for channel 161 with a 40MHz bandwidth.

SLE Metric:Roaming One of the key metrics that affect user experience in a network is efficient roaming of clients between access points. Mist now extends its Service Level key metrics with a Roaming SLE that captures client roaming efficiency on the network. Metrics and classifiers for roaming are included in our Root Cause Analysis dashboard. The user can adjust and set their target for expected time it takes for a client to roam between 2 access points. Here we have our goal set at 0.4 seconds to roam. The following classification is used for Roaming SLE: Slow 11r Roams  Takes more than 400 msec or have 11r failures before success Slow Standard Roams  Roams on SSIDs without 11r/OKC that took more than 400 msec Slow OKC Roams  Takes more than 400 msec or have okc failures before success Failed to Fast Roams  Fast roam capable clients that did slow roam on a SSID enabled for fast roam Link to SLE Dashboard & Insights,snippet,,5,

password policy of the org,,,,,,,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/february-25th-2021-updates/,1.5291419,Now Org admins can enforce 2-factor authentication as well as password restrictions for any user who has access to the site or organization. In the Organization Settings page (Organization > Settings) there is a Password Policy section where you may select Require 2-factor authentication. Users without 2FA enabled on their accounts will be redirected to their Account Settings page and be prompted to enable 2FA. The same behavior applies to those with passwords that dont satisfy the Org Password Policy. Until the user makes the needed changes to their password/2FA they will be locked out of navigating the organization.,snippet,,1,

Now add labels and policies at the organization level to be applied to multiple sites at once. Setup Org level policies using the same method as site level policies. First create and define your Org level labels accessible throughOrganization -> Labels.  Using these Org labels create Org Policies in the template view (Organization -> Config Templates). Organization level policies take precedence over Site level policies so your Site level policies will only take effect only if none of the Org level policy conditions match the client behavior.,snippet,,3,

Now you can configure the grace period and the behavior after the grace period ends for installer roles in your organization. To do so navigate to your org settings page (Organization > Settings) and find the Installer section. The Grace period is a set number of days where the installer admin can have access to your sites. Select the Allow extra sites after grace period option to keep allowing access to certain sites after the grace period has ended.

ap radio is down and need help to create a ticket for rma,,,,,,,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/ap41-operate-802-3af/,1.328177,In 0.1.X and earlier the AP would try to operate on any power. If the power was less than 802.3at (30w) the behavior of the AP was inconsistent. It may or may not connect to the cloud. It may or may not serve wifi clients. The bigger problem was that in case it did not connect to the cloud it was a problem to troubleshoot the issue. In 0.2.X if the power to the AP was less than 802.3at the AP will disable the radios BUT will still connect to the cloud. As the radios are disabled no wifi clients can connect to the AP BUT as the AP is connected to the cloud troubleshooting is easier as we can clearly see in the AP logs that it is not getting 802.3at power. Example operational scenarios:,snippet,,1,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/wifi-doesnt-work-certain-times-day/,1.3230302,Our backend RRM algorithm upon detecting interference or radar may choose to change the channel on the AP. However the decision to change the channel on the AP is based on a baseline value it may take up to a few moments until the algorithm decides to change the channel. Additionally once the AP changes the channel it will momentarily drop all the clients associated to it by sending a Deauthentication and may cause a disruption in the Wi-Fi service for the AP momentarily. More information can be found on this under Channel utilization of the AP and the channel occupancy (Go to NetworkRadio Management) . Radio events give information on whether or not the AP actually changed channel/power or made any radio related changes.,snippet,,2,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/may-20th-2021-updates/,1.3018205,This week we are bringing you two new Actions in the Connectivity section of the Marvis Action Dashboard  ARP Failure and DNS Failure. These two Actions make use of our Anomaly Detection model to identify sites with clients experiencing an unusually high number of failures for ARP and DNS events. You can access the Anomaly Detection details card directly from the Action Dashboard page to see a timeline of failures as well as the impact of APs WLANs and Radio Bands to pinpoint the source of the issue. Click on the View Anomaly link in the Details column to open up the Anomaly Detection card.

Devices with different security options can connect to the same WLAN using their supported encryption method. With Multi-mode legacy devices and modern devices can connect to a single WLAN preventing the need of separate WLANs supporting different security options. Previously Multi-mode WLANs were limited to any combination of WPA WPA2 CCMP TKIP and WEP while using a PSK passphrase. This week we are extending the Multi-mode WLAN options by supporting EAP (802.1X) logins with WPA WPA2 CCMP and TKIP encryptions. To set up a Multi-mode WLAN create a new WLAN and expand the security options by clicking onMore Options. Here select Multi-mode/EAP(802.1X) and customize which encryption methods to configure your WLAN with. Be sure to add a RADIUS Authentication Server in order to finish setting up your WLAN.

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/september-17th-2020-updates/,1.4619572,This week we have made it easier for you to select switches to assign when configuring a switch template. Applying templates to switches are done by filtering switch roles switch models or the prefix of a switch name. We are improving the Apply by Switch name function by allowing you to specify an offset (in number characters) for where the name matching will start instead of just limiting you to prefix matching. This will be very useful for those sites with switch names with formats where the switch name does not come first e.g. Building #  Room #  Switch #. To apply a template to all switches with a certain name just enter your offset for which character to begin the name matching. Access your Switch Templates through Organization > Switch Templates.,snippet,,2,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/may-20th-2021-updates/,1.4572916,To help improve the flow of configuring and applying Switch Templates we have added the ability to apply switch templates to sites directly from the Switch Templates page. Before we required you to first Create or Import a switch template and then navigate to the Network > Switch Configuration page to assign that template to a site. Now we have simplified the workflow by allowing you to apply your switch template from the same page where you created or imported your template. Please note that we did not remove the ability to assign sites in the Switch Configuration page  we simply added this ability onto the Switch Templates page. In the Switch Templates page (Organization > Switch Templates) you can now use the Assign to Sites function when viewing your templates. Use the pop up to easily assign your template to the intended sites.,snippet,,3,

There are already a few existing ways to create a switch template and this week we are adding to that by allowing you to create templates directly from the Switch Details page. From the Utilities dropdown menu select Create Template. This will copy all of the existing switch configurations to a new template which may then be used to apply to other switches. To apply your Switch Configuration Template to a site go to your Switch Configuration page (Network > Switch Configuration) and select your desired site. Click into the site and at the top you may select a Configuration Template from the dropdown list. You may also select multiple sites from the list and apply a single template to them.,snippet,,5,

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/saml-setup-azure-ad/,1.5724198,Follow the Azure guide for a general understanding of creating an Azure AD (AAD) SSO application: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-custom-apps 1. In the Mist Web GUI navigate to Organization > Settings. Under the Single Sign-on section create an Identity Provider by clicking Add IPD.Once you create an Identity the ACS URL and Single Logout URL will be created by default. 2. In Azure AD configure with the appropriate values: a. Identifier (Entity ID): Mist supports either a generic or an SSO-specific Entity ID. Generic: https://saml.mist.comSSO-specific: https://saml-<DOMAIN>.mist.comThis can be obtained from https://api.mist.com/api/v1/orgs/:org_id/ssos/:sso_id/metadata (replacing the :object_id with the appropriate IDs). b. Reply URL: Get the ACS URL directly from the UI.ie: https://api.mist.com/api/v1/saml/<DOMAIN>/login Both of these above values we need to set up under the Basic SAML Configuration. c. User identifier: user.mail d. SAML Token Attributes: Send the attributes with these names (case sensitive): FirstName LastName Name ID Role where Role is your custom LDAP rule to pass Mist the appropriate administrator role e. Mist requires the full Message to be signed: Under the Advanced Certificate Signing options select Sign SAML response and assertion. 3. In the Mist Web GUI finish configuring the SSO IdP: a. Issuer: Obtain from the AAD Federation Metadata. ie: https://sts.windows.net/01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef/ b. Certificate: Obtain from AAD. Note: Please make sure to include the cert headers/footers. c. SSO URL: Obtain from the AAD Federation Metadata. We can get the Login URL from the AD owner. 4. In the Mist Web GUI create the corresponding roles under the Single Sign-on section. The Role Name should match the Role being sent in the AAD SAML Assertion.,snippet,,2,

If the power was less than 802.3at (30w) the behavior of the AP was inconsistent. It may or may not connect to the cloud. It may or may not serve wifi clients. The bigger problem was that in case it did not connect to the cloud it was a problem to troubleshoot the issue. In 0.2.X if the power to the AP was less than 802.3at the AP will disable the radios BUT will still connect to the cloud. As the radios are disabled no wifi clients can connect to the AP BUT as the AP is connected to the cloud troubleshooting is easier as we can clearly see in the AP logs that it is not getting 802.3at power.

s2105 download floor plan,,,,,,,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/good-location-setup/,1.3548204,Good Location Setup Scale the Floor Plan,subtitle,,1,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/good-location-setup/,1.33782,To scale the floor plan Select Live View from the Location side navigation menu. 2. Select the site and floor plan you want to scale 3. Click on Setup floor plan. 4. Confirm by clicking OK. 5. Select the Set Scale option. 6. Scale the floor plan and save. Scale can be thought of as the foundation for your location accuracy. If for example a room is 10 meters long but you scale the room to be 1000 meters long in the system then when you physically walk 5 meters the system UI would only reflect you as moving one inch. This gives the false impression that the location is broken; however the location has actually placed you correctly based on the provided scale. Thus it is crucial that your floor plan is scaled properly. One trick if you dont know the scale of a floor plan is to look for a standard door and scale that door to be 0.91 meters (3 feet). This should scale the floor plan appropriately. Next set AP placement. Note: Set Origin can be used to modify the 00 coordinates of the floor plan. This is typically not necessary and is most commonly used in conjunction with third party systems.,snippet,,2,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/good-location-setup/,1.3164501,Select Live View from the Location side navigation menu.Select the site and floor plan you want to scale.Unlock the floor plan for editing.Select the AP from the Available APs option.Drag and drop the AP on the floor plan. AP placement is simple yet important. In the UI just drag and drop the AP onto the floor plan where the AP is deployed in the real world. For example lets say you have a 10 x 10 meter room and physically deploy the AP in the center of the room. You would do the same in the system by placing the AP on the middle of the floor plan in the UI. If you physically move that AP to the upper-right corner of the room then you would also need to update the system by moving that AP to the upper-right corner of the floor plan. It is important to ensure that the MAC address of the AP placed in the system matches that of the AP in the physical deployment. If the APs and their placements do not match this will give the false impression that the location is broken; the system will show your location in a different area on the floor plan.,snippet,,3,

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/isolation/,1.4531729,By default Mist supports Proxy Arp. Mist APs by default support Proxy ARP.

can you set switch IP address from cloud,,,,,,,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/troubleshooting-ap-disconnect-issues/,1.4495884,Explanation: The green/yellow LED pattern on the AP indicates that the AP is connecting to the cloud. Whenever an AP boots up it tries to connect to the cloud to fetch its configurations. Steps to Troubleshoot: Our APs need some specific ports to be opened on the firewall to get connected to the cloud. Please go through this page: https://www.mist.com/documentation/ports-enable-firewall/ to see which ports need to be enabled.If all the ports mentioned in the above URL are enabled and the AP is still blinking green/yellow connect a laptop on the same switch port and try to go to the URL: https://ep-terminator.mistsys.net/about in the browser to check if that resolves the host. You should get an output that looks something like:{,,,,
"version: ""0.3.4476""",,,,,,,

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/wifi-doesnt-work-certain-times-day/,1.2603372,Interference (especially Radar) may disrupt Wi-Fi services at a particular time of the day. Certain Wi-Fi dependent devices such as IoT devices Wi-Fi LED lights etc can also add to the channel utilization. This may lead to slowness or inability to pass traffic for the clients. You can review the Channel Occupancy of all the channels under NetworkRadio Management as well as the Channel Utilization for the AP under AP insights. To mitigate this you can use the Optimize Now button which will force the AP to change to the best available channel based on our scan radio calculations.,snippet,,2,

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/wifi-doesnt-work-certain-times-day/,1.2431943,Our backend RRM algorithm upon detecting interference or radar may choose to change the channel on the AP. However the decision to change the channel on the AP is based on a baseline value it may take up to a few moments until the algorithm decides to change the channel. Additionally once the AP changes the channel it will momentarily drop all the clients associated to it by sending a Deauthentication and may cause a disruption in the Wi-Fi service for the AP momentarily. More information can be found on this under Channel utilization of the AP and the channel occupancy (Go to NetworkRadio Management) . Radio events give information on whether or not the AP actually changed channel/power or made any radio related changes.,snippet,,4,

You can now customize this sponsor Email when configuring your Guest portal WLAN. When configuring your Guest portal in the Authorization tab select Sponsored Guest Access and fill out the allowed email domains. After doing so you will be able to select Customize Email. Here you may edit the Email Template using HTML and see a preview of what your Email will look like. To learn more about Guest Portals and Sponsored Guest Access please visit our Guest Access section in the documentation site: https://www.mist.com/documentation/category/guest/,snippet,,4,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/sponsored-guest-access-wlan/,1.3729104,The Mist Captive Portal can be customized with a range of authorization options to cater to your specific needs as a network administrator. To improve its security capabilities we are introducing the option of adding a sponsored guest access authorization for users attempting to login using the portal. With sponsored guest access enabled clients signing in to the portal need to be approved by a sponsor in order to successfully connect to the network. This will prevent unknown and unapproved users from connecting to your private guest WLAN. To set up a sponsored guest access WLAN navigate to Network > WLANs and select the Add WLAN button. Configure a Guest Portal and in the Authorization tab select Sponsored Guest Access. Here enter the email domain for the sponsors who will be approving the logins. You may customize the time window in which the sponsor needs to approve the login attempt  by default we have this set at 60 minutes. In a portal with multiple authorization methods set up guests who need sponsor approval for login will select Sign in as Guest on the splash page. For portals without other authorization methods the sponsored login page will be displayed by default. Fill in the required fields and select Notify Sponsor. The sponsor will then receive an email requesting access for the user. Here the sponsor can either accept or deny their request. If accepted the guest will now be approved and be automatically connected to the network.,snippet,,5,

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/ssid-scheduling/,1.3297707,SSID Scheduling allows you to customize your WLAN by choosing the exact days and times to broadcast the SSID. This scheduling function was limited to setting one time period per day but starting now you may add multiple time ranges for each day. An example use case for this feature would be a classroom with multiple classes throughout each day but break periods in between some of these classes. You can enable the SSID for all of the times when there are classes being taught and disable the SSID during break periods. To use SSID Scheduling navigate to Network > WLANS and either create a new one or click into an existing one to edit. Find the SSID Scheduling box and select Enabled. Here you can set the desired schedule by selecting the days of the week which need scheduling. Set your time range and click Add to enable additional time ranges for that day. Please Note: Currently when setting an SSID schedule the APs radios will restart so only make scheduling changes when there are not a lot of users on the network to limit the impact. This issue has been resolved in firmware 0.5x or later.,snippet,,5,

Perhaps a school or large store were the important devices are managed and their ability to operate and roam in 5Ghz is well known and maybe you are less concerned about the guest network and the wide variety of devices that may show up. You may not want to leverage auto cancellation or auto conversion in areas where you have lower coverage and mission critical (2.4 GHz only) devices like legacy PoS devices are important.,snippet,,5,

What is the Poe draw for port a switchport?,,,,,,,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/july-29th-2021-updates/,1.3885351,We resolved an issue observed where APs connected to PoE injectors (not a switch) were not showing up correctly on our AP Offline Actions. Starting this week these types of AP offline events will be detected and displayed correctly. The switch and port information will just display as unknown. We fixed an issue observed for the Port Flaps Marvis Action where the port details were displayed as unknown. Newly incoming Port Flaps actions will now display correctly with the Port information and VLAN information (if known).,snippet,,1,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/september-23rd-2021-updates/,1.3700687,Earlier we announced the Marvis Action to catch cases where your EX switch is experiencing continuous flapping on particular ports. Starting this week we are excited to introduce the ability to disable these flapping ports directly through the Action Dashboard page. In your Actions Dashboard page find the Port Flap actions under the Switch section. Select your desired item with the check box and the Disable Port button will appear. Clicking on this will bring up a Disable Port modal that lists out the ports available for you to disable. Please note that if a port is already disabled (either previously through the Action Dashboard or manually from the Switch Details page) the check box will be grayed out already. Once you select OK the port configurations on the selected ports will change to disabled and those ports will be down. You can re-enable these ports from the Switch Details page by selecting the port directly and editing the port configurations.,snippet,,2,

rfid tags,,,,,,,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/august-21st-2020-updates/,1.2414372,Requires custom firmware please reach out to us for access This week we are starting support for the integration of AeroScout tags with our Mist APs allowing us to process and forward the Wi-Fi packets received from the AeroScout tags. AeroScout Tags periodically transmit a short Wi-Fi message that is received by Mist APs within range. The Mist APs measure the Received Signal Strength of the message and forwards the message with its Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) to the AeroScout Engine Server. Using the RSSI data we are able to determine an accurate location of each tag as long as at least 3 APs are detecting the Wi-Fi messages transmitted by the tags. To configure AeroScout from the Mist UI navigate to your Access Points Details page and provide a Host address in the AeroScout section. Make sure to select the Configure AeroScout checkbox as well.,snippet,,1,

In this case one can search for all client events pertaining to the Guest WLAN. VNA can give a detailed description of all the events as can be seen from the above including the redirect URL VLAN tag AP BSSID. In this case we have used the Mist guest portal but we can also see the redirect URL in case on external portal. We can look for more investigative data under Client Insights for the failing client. Typically if the issue is with DNS not being able to resolve the external portal redirect URL you should see DNS failures under client events for the failing client. This coupled with only Portal redirection events and no Portal authorization events could point to the fact that DNS server is not able to resolve the URL after Mist successfully tried to redirect the client to the URL. If multiple clients report the issue then you should see a DNS server failing warning under Analytics  Events. If you check for event details on the event Portal Redirection in Progress you should see the redirect URL link. In case of an external portal you can use the below link to verify and check if all the necessary information has been included: http://portal.mist.com/authorize-howto If you do see a portal redirection event on the client insights but do not see any Captive Portal (CNA) pop-up on your device you can try to browse to an unsecured website (http://) since redirection only Port 80 for majority Operating Systems. If you do see redirection to the portal on your browser you can use the Guest authorization method and see a Portal Auth Success event for the client. One additional check that needs to be performed is to see if the AP has cloud connectivity or not. For guest authorization the AP queries the cloud to get authorization information about the client. If the AP is unreachable to the cloud Guest authorization information regarding the client cannot be retrieved. This scenario can be mitigated by checking the Bypass portal in case of exception option under your Guest WLAN configurations as shown below.,snippet,,3,

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/why-do-clients-disconnect-when-you-add-a-new-wlan/,1.4454161,Making changes on the WLAN will cause the radio to reinitialize in order to obtain the new configuration. The radio reinitializes when adding a new WLAN or making any RF related changes to the WLAN. On the Client Events in the Insights page you will see an AP Deauthentication being sent to the clients when the changes are made. You can refer the audit log for the same. Because of this behavior we advise making WLAN changes on a site after business hours so that none of the services will get impacted. Client events in theInsights page: Audit logs showing this event:,snippet,,2,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/october-17th-2017-updates/,1.435485,Prevent unnecessary congestion of multiple clients by configuring an inactivity timer on your WLAN. Clients inactive for a defined amount of time will be deauthenticated from the network. Use this function in retail spaces where multiple clients connect to the WLAN but may stand idle after the user is done using the internet. This allows for active users to make use of the network and prevent the crowding of idle clients. Configure your inactivity timer in the range of 60  3600 seconds. By default the timer will be set for 1800 seconds. Navigate toNetwork->WLANsto find the Client inactivity section to modify the timer.,snippet,,3,
,https://www.mist.com/documentation/june-7th-2018-updates-marvis/,1.4275701,Taking data from all Clients WLANs radio bands APs Operating Systems and client types we compare our client to all other clients on the site. Using this data you can see what factors are correlated to network problems. For example if every client on a specific WLAN is having issues that WLAN will show up as a red bar implying a negative correlation to the other WLANs. A blue bar means a positive correlation (mostly good events).

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/october-10th-2017-updates/,1.3902785,Use proximity location as an attribute to enable access to your WLAN. Configure a WLAN with a minimum RSSI threshold to allow clients to connect to the network. Take advantage of this feature by limiting the WiFi reach of your network to inside the four walls. Prevent users from logging in from the parking lot or any other area outside of sanctioned areas. To enable geofenced WLANs navigate toNetwork -> WLANsto create a new WLAN. Scroll down to find theGeofencesection where you can set the allowed RSSI range in dBm for clients devices. Note: This proximity based access is only for the initial association. If a client is already associated to the network they will not be dissociated if their RSSI value falls below the configured threshold.,snippet,,5,

,https://www.mist.com/documentation/isolation/,1.4406644,By default Mist supports Proxy Arp. Mist APs by default support Proxy ARP. Mist APs on seeing an ARP request for a connected client instead of forwarding the packet over the air format an ARP response on behalf of the client and respond to the wired network. Wikipedia ARP Filter: When ARP filter is enabled we block all ARP broadcast requests from going to the specified wireless Interface. When ARP filter Is disabled Proxy ARP will try to resolve the Ethernet address of requests and if not known will flood the original request to any Interface not being ARP filtered.Broadcast / Multicast Filter: When Enabled this filter will BLOCK ALL broadcasts and Multicast packets on a specified Interface except: a) ARPs (thats handled above) b) DHCP broadcast transactions. c) IPv6 Neighbor discovery frames. (ICMPv6). All other broadcasts will we blocked including IPv6 broadcasts / multi-casts and ALL MDNS frames. (IPv4 & IPv6)Allow MDNS Checkbox:  This option ONLY has any effect when #2 (the Broadcast / Multicast filter is ENABLED). When selected this option will ALLOW mDNS packets to transmitted through the specified interface. This includes IPv4 and IPv6 mDNS. If Not selected then the Broadcast/Multicast filter will treat mDNS frames just like any other broadcast/multicast frame and block them. Apple Bonjour uses MDNS for their network discovery and might be a broadcast you want to be sent. Wikipedia DTIM  a period of 2 beacons is normal this can be increased for power sensitive clients,snippet,,4,
